###  vue 3 refresh  

Whe declaring **template** code  in separate const outside the `Vue.create` app and in a js file, have it on top of the Vue declaration for loading before initialization.   
**props ** only flow from parent to child direction.  
Props are attributes that need to be given a value in the parent component and explicitly declared in the child component.  
`v-bind` or `:` is used to bind dynamic values as props in the parent component.
